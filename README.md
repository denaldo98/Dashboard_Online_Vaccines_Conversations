# Dashboard Vaccines

Project realized for the course *Unstructured and Streaming Data Engineering* at *Politecnico di Milano*. 
 
 The goal of the dashboard is to monitor Italian conversations around vaccines on social media (Twitter, Facebook) and understand the interplay between online public discourse and vaccine hesitancy/uptake rates.

The dashboard is realized using [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-gb/).


 - The folder [data](https://github.com/denaldo98/USDE_project/tree/main/data) contains the excel files used for building the dashboard (data taken from [https://github.com/frapierri/VaccinItaly](https://github.com/frapierri/VaccinItaly) )
 - [Dashboard_Vaccini.pbix](https://github.com/denaldo98/USDE_project/blob/main/Dashboard_Vaccini.pbix) is the Power BI file with the dashboard.
 - [Dashboard_Vaccini.pdf](https://github.com/denaldo98/USDE_project/blob/main/Dashboard_Vaccini.pdf) is the pdf version of the Power BI file (with static plots).
